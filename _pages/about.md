Hi! Iâ€™m Kuleen Sasse, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) advised by [Gillian Hadfield](https://www.gillianhadfield.com/). I am broadly interested in AI Safety and Responsible AI. 

I am fortunate for my work to be supported by [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

In my free time, I like baking, hunting Wikipedia for fun facts, learning about retro phones and computers, and exploring random and off the beaten path places!
