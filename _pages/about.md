Hi! Iâ€™m Kuleen Sasse, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) advised by [Gillian Hadfield](https://gillianhadfield.org/). I am broadly interested in AI Safety and Responsible AI. I am fortunate for my work to be supported by [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

Please contact me if you're interested in collaboration, advice, or just want to chat please reach out to me via my email!  

During my undergraduate, I was advised by [John Osborne](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/informatics/about/dbids-faculty/john-d-osborne-ph-d) and [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) and spent summers at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/) as a Research Scientist and Research Engineering intern. Through those 4 years: I worked with a host of people on a diverse set of problems spanning:
- Multimodal and Vision-Language Models
- Biomedical and Clinical NLP
- AI Safety and Fairness
- Building Open Pretraining Corpora

In my free time, I like baking, hunting Wikipedia for fun facts, learning about retro phones and computers, geeking about transit, wandering museums, and exploring random and off the beaten path places!
